## Installation
In order to use this code, you first need to install two other projects: [multidim-threshold](https://github.com/mvcisback/multidim-threshold), and [py-stl](https://github.com/mvcisback/py-stl). This involves downloading the folders multidim-threshold and py-stl from these repositories respectively, and putting them in the same directory as the code from this repository.
